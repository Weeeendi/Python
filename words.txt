You have got a wild side
　　You're an animal tonight
　　I see that you are my type
　　Wild like a tiger hunting the prey
　　We'll keep the neighbours up all night
　　Hot in the jungle exotic apparel
　　I can see the way that you're looking at me
　　Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
　　Won't tame you love the way you're watching me
　　Baby i'll keep you up all night
　　Gotta tie you up incase you bite
